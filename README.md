Portfolio Analysis & Visualization (SQL + Tableau)

📌 Overview

This project delivers a full portfolio performance and risk analysis for a client’s investment holdings using SQL and Tableau. The analysis evaluates returns across multiple time horizons, identifies low-risk and high-efficiency assets, computes risk-adjusted returns, and provides data-driven recommendations for portfolio optimization.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	Calculate 12, 18, 24-month returns for all securities.
	•	Measure portfolio-level performance (full portfolio return: 257%).
	•	Compute volatility (sigma) and average daily returns for each asset.
	•	Identify top-performing and lowest-risk securities.
	•	Evaluate risk-adjusted returns similar to Sharpe Ratio.
	•	Recommend new additions and rebalancing strategies based on risk and performance.
	•	Visualize trends using Tableau dashboards.

⸻

🔍 Key Insights
	•	Top returns included 102% (18 months) and 82% (24 months) among strong ETFs and equity assets.
	•	Lowest-volatility securities (e.g., IGSB with 0.2% sigma) provide strong stability anchors.
	•	Highest risk-adjusted returns came from PFIX, KRBN, KMLM, ARB, and LBAY.
	•	Portfolio shows efficiency gaps—high-return assets do not always offer strong risk-adjusted value.
	•	Diversification reveals imbalances across asset classes and volatility clusters.
	•	Recommendations include strategic rebalancing, divesting high-volatility underperformers, and increasing exposure to high-efficiency assets.
